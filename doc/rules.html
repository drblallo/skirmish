### Actions 

* act `evaluate_random_stat(frm Stat, frm Int) -> RollStat`

```
 Rappresents the evaluation of stats such as the damage stat
 of weapons, which sometime is written as 1D6 + 3
```

   * act `quantity(Dice dice)`

        ```
 if the stat has a dice component, 
 selects the value for that dice 
```
* act `rerollable_pair_dices_roll(ctx Board, frm Bool, frm Bool, frm Bool, frm Int) -> RerollableDicePair`

```
 This action rappresents charge rolls and morale tests, where the user 
 must roll two dices, can sometime benefit from a reroll due to special rules
 and finally can use a command point to reroll the dices.
```

   * act `roll_pair(frm Dice result, frm Dice result2)`

        ```
 sets the value for the rolled pair
```
   * act `keep_it(Bool do_it)`

        ```
 reject the possibility of rerolling the dice and 
 keep the value of the dice.
```
   * act `reroll_pair(Dice new_value, Dice new_value2)`

        ```
 set a new value of the rolled pair
```
* act `rerollable_dice_roll(ctx Board, frm Bool, frm Bool, frm Bool, frm Int) -> RerollableDice`

```
 Rappresents all those situations in which a player must roll a dice
 for example advance rolls or hit rolls, and can sometime benefit 
 from a temporary reroll rule, or can spend a command point
```

   * act `roll(frm Dice result)`

        ```
 sets the value for the rolled dice
```
   * act `keep_it(Bool do_it)`

        ```
 reject the possibility of rerolling the dice and keep the current result
```
   * act `reroll(Dice new_value)`

        ```
 resets the rolled value
```
* act `single_attack(ctx Board, ctx Unit, ctx Unit) -> SingleAttack`

```
 Evaulates a single attack from a given model to a target unit
 A single attack can generate multiple hits, for example because
 of rules such as sutained_hits. 
 If the target is destroyed, this action triggers eventual on death
 mechanics.
```

   * act `allocate_wound(frm ModelID id)`

 can be used

 given a particular weapon used. the weapon is provided by 
 configuring board.attack_info.source
```

* act `resolve_model_attack(ctx Board, frm UnitID, frm UnitID, frm Int, frm Bool) -> ModelAttack`

```
 this is the game sequence where a player selects one or more
 weapons, depending how many the model can use, to fight with 
 the target unit, and resolves those weapons one at the time
```

 be triggered after a target has been elected to attack,
 but before attacks get resolved.
